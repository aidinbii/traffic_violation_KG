# Traffic violations in Bishkek
Here I provide the Jupyter notebook with the analysis for this [post](link). \
You can reproduce all the tables and figures yourself.

But first you need to download the data. The data for this analysis comes from [Open Data Platform of Kyrgyzstan](https://data.gov.kg/en/). \
The excel sheets could be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1buAWJahlZSgZQ6_C73dyGaEZjv-yqhf3?usp=share_link).

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
